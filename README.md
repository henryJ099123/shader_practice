This is the shader stuff I'm learning (mostly from the Book of Shaders)
- These shaders are all written in `GLSL`, the OpenGL Shading Language.

I run my sketches through a processing sketch that can be run at the command line
  - change the second line of the processing sketch (`String filename = "some_text.filename"` to the file in `/data` you want if running the sketch thru the processing IDE
  - otherwise, to run the sketch at the command line, make sure you have `processing-java` installed to your device
    and run the sketch at the command line with the shader name as the last argument
  - or you can paste these into an online glsl editor and it will work there too
  
  You can also very easily run this code in vscode by using the `glsl-canvas` extension by `circledev`.
  - I also recommend getting some shader language support extension, especially for GLSL.
